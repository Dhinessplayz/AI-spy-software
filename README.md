# AI-spy-software
This software is open-sourced. The software would be able to use Artificial intelligence and other tailored spyware to spy on people (with permission obviously) and the AI comes into play when the data collected can be accessed by asking the AI about the data and not searching for it. 


Key - points
1. Open-sourced
2. For educational purposes only
3. the main purpose of the software is the easy accesibilty of data gathered from spyware through AI to show how AI can be tailored to do anything
4. The project will be a collaborative project, and changes may apply based on the suggestions made by you guys
