> The AI software now has a base and I'am desinging a GUI for user asthetics
> I managed to pull the Keylogger from another repo of mine and added it to the project
> I created a Progress folder for you guys to track the progress (Could have done it without a folder)
> New plans for making the AI separate from the keylogger so the keylogger could be on a device and the AI can access data from the Keylogger but the AI is in a different device (Remote-access)
> New folder called Ideas now has all the ideas for future implementation (Check it to see how you can contribute)
