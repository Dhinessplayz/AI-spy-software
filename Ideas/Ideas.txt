Below is a list of ideas for future implementation (Create a issue on this file if you want to contribute!)

1. Separate the Keylogger and AI so the AI can remotely access and display data from another display (Splitting the package makes it take less storage)
2. Make the AI run on a Raspberry PI with a small display connected to it so it can be carried anywhere and be handheld (Remove the requirement of a phone or a Laptop reducing the probability that someone else has access to the AI)
3. Create a GUI for the AI for better user interaction
4. Add other tailored spyware other than the keylogger (i.e Location grabber) to really push the limits and show how AI can be implemented for the wrong things
